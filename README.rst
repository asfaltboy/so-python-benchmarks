StackOverflow Python Testing and Benchmarks
###########################################

This repo contains my ipython notebooks that test and time (i.e benchmark) python code from stackoverflow questions/answers.

This exists mostly to quench my curiousity thirst, and does not aim to be a definite truth or even a comprehensive benchmark of any kind.
